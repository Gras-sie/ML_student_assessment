## Dash App for BrightPath Academy

The Dash app is designed to help educators at BrightPath Academy predict students' academic performance using the Random Forest model. Teachers can input student details, and the app will predict the grade class. Additionally, the app provides visualizations to identify features that may lead to academic challenges, enabling targeted interventions.
